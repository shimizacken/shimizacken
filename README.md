### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Shimi

I'm a senior frontend developer with 15+ years of experience building enterprise web applications. I specialize in frontend architecture, TypeScript, and modern React-based solutions. I enjoy clean code, testing, refactoring legacy systems, and mentoring teams.  

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a passionate photographer and love exploring new places with my camera.  

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out or connect!
